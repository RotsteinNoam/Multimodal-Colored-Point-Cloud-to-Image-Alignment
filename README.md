# Multimodal Colored Point Cloud to Image Alignment

This is a repo of the [paper](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2022/html/Rotstein_Multimodal_Colored_Point_Cloud_to_Image_Alignment_CVPR_2022_paper.html).

We encourage you to look at the implementation of the paper and an example of its use in the following [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1M_FX4BNDZdSvyzG-htjs-g_IlSvn1mwM#scrollTo=D9dS327Qjef_).
This demonstration includes an example in which we show how to optimize the color difference between a colored point cloud and an image under multimodality settings.
